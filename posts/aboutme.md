# About Me

I'm a highly motivated data science graduate (still pursuing) with expertise in data analysis and business intelligence. I'm seeking a challenging role as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst. I'm committed to leveraging data-driven strategies for optimal decision-making and organizational performance.
